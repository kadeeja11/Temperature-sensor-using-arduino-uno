# Temperature-sensor-using-arduino-uno
Abstract
Introduction: A temperature sensor is a device that is designed to measure the degree of hotness or coolness in an object. The temperature sensor in Arduino converts the surrounding temperature to voltage.
Hardware required: Arduino UNO, breadboard, DS18B20 sensor, resistor 4.7KΩ, LCD16*2 character, ic2 display
Principle: We will connect the LCD Display and DS18b20 temperature sensor with the Arduino UNO board. The sensor detects the surrounding temperature and converts it into volts, to Celsius to Fahrenheit, and displays Fahrenheit temperature on the LCD screen.
Application: There are many Application for a temperature sensor out of which few are listed below:
•	To find the mean temperature for the month 
•	To find the safe temperature for baby bath 
•	To check the body temperature of a person
•	To check the temperature of the computer system so as to ensure it doesn’t overheat
